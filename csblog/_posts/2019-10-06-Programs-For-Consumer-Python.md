## Programs for Consumers in Python
I generally tend to backend development. Which means that the only interfaces I am usually
concerned with are CLI based. But most command line based applications are designed for other developers to use
or in the best case, at least power users. I thought for a change I would work on something that is user-friendly.

For the purpose of this post, we will take a look at two libraries/tools Tkinter and PyInstaller.
Tkinter can be used to develop GUI interfaces while PyInstaller make it easy to package your application into a single executable file that can be run by the end-user without having to install any extra libraries or tools.

I do my development on a Linux or MacOS machine where things are easier to install but since tkinter is part of the Python standard library since Python 3.1. I would simply recommend using that python version or higher when developing on Windows. Also note that it is Tkinter for Python 2 and tkinter for Python 3 when you are importing the library.
