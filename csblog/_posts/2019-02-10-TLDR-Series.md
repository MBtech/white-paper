## TL;DR Research Papers
So many papers, so little time. So, I am going to be writing very short summaries of
research papers that I read. I hope that it will be useful for myself (down the road) and
other people as well.

The summaries will often not go in detailed discussions but instead they are supposed to help people pick papers for further reading that might of interest to them. Take a look at [The morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org) if you are interested in getting a bit more detailed summaries of research works.
