If you want to setup a local k3s kubernetes cluster then I would recommend using k3d. It's a docker-in-docker solution which means that you can have a multi-node k3s cluster on your host directly. Take a look at [this guide](https://felixwiedmann.de/k3d-manage-k3s-clusters/) for more information.

I am going to setup a a distributed kubernetes cluster on my local servers.
