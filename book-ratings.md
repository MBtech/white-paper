## My Book Ratings

Here's a bunch of books that I have read (listened to) and my ratings for them. Maybe it could help you select a new book to read. Most of them have been audiobooks unless I explicitly mention it and they are not CS books generally. A rating of 5 means an average book, it doesn't mean that the book was bad. Just that it was nothing special or intriguing.
